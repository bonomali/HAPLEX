# HAPLEX
Combinatorial and statistical prediction of gene expression from haplotype sequence

This repository contains the code for two methods that predict gene expression from haplotype data: HAPLEXR and HAPLEXD.
HAPLEXR is a penalized regression-based method that combines a SHAPEIT-like genetic model with allelic dosages to render continuous predictions.
HAPLEXD combines a suffix tree genetic model with spectral clustering to compute discrete expression predictions.
